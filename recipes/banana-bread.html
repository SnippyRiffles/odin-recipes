    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour: This chocolate chip banana bread starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip banana bread, but it won't make it taste salty.</li>
            <li>Bananas: You'll need to mash three ripe bananas.</li>
            <li>Milk: A tablespoon of milk adds moisture.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon lends welcome warmth.</li>
            <li>Sugar: This recipe calls for white sugar, but some Allrecipes community members like to use a blend of brown and white sugars.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Whole eggs keep the banana bread moist and help bind the batter together.</li>
            <li>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need chocolate chips!</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan, preferably glass.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
            Stir bananas, milk, and cinnamon in another bowl.
            Beat sugar and butter together in a third bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy;
            add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
            Stir banana mixture into butter mixture; mix in flour mixture until just blended.
            Fold in chocolate chips; pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes.
            Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
